347801,cmn,如果外頭還有人懷疑，美國是否真的是任何事都可能發生的地方，懷疑我們開國先賢的夢想今天是否依然存在，懷疑我們民主的力量；今夜，就是你們要的答案。,"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer."
347803,cmn,這是個用這個國家前所未見的，環繞學校、教堂的無數人龍，所說出的答案。這些人苦等三、四個小時投票，許多人還是生平頭一次，因為他們相信，這次一定要不一樣，他們的聲音就是明證。,"It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches, in numbers this nation has never seen. By people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference."

Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and always will be, the United States of America."
347814,cmn,看，這是我的名片。,"Look, this is my business card."
347816,cmn,就是這個答案，讓那些長久以來被灌輸要嘲諷、害怕和懷疑自身能力的人們 把他們的手放在歷史的弧線上，將它彎向一個更美好的一天的希望。,"It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long, by so many, to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve, to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day."
347817,cmn,已經過去了很長時間，但是今晚，由於我們今天在這場選舉所采取的行動，在這個決定性的時候，變革來到了美國。,"It's been a long time coming; but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America."
347818,cmn,今晚稍早，我接到馬侃參議員打來，態度非常懇切的電話。馬侃參議員已打完一場漫長艱苦的選戰。他為這個他所熱愛的國家所打的仗更久，更艱苦。他為美國的奉獻犧牲，是我們多數同胞難以想像的。因為有他這位勇敢無私的領袖的奉獻，我們才能過比較好的日子。,"A little bit earlier this evening, I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Senator McCain. Senator McCain fought long and hard in this campaign. And he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader."
347819,cmn,我向他道賀；也向裴林州長道賀，為他們所成就的一切。我迫不及待想和他們攜手合作，在未來數月更新這個國家的許諾。,"I congratulate him, I congratulate Governor Palin for all that they've achieved. And I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead."
347820,cmn,我要感謝我的選舉搭檔，這位先生全心全意競選，為與他在史克蘭頓街頭一起長大的男男女女代言。在前往德拉瓦州的路上，和我一起以火車為家，他就是副總統當選人，拜登先生。,"I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart, and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton, and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the vice president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden."
347821,cmn,如果沒有我過去16年最好的朋友、我們家庭的中堅、我生命中的摯愛，我今天晚上不可能站在這裏，美國下一位第一夫人米歇爾-奧巴馬。,"And I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next first lady, Michelle Obama."
347822,cmn,薩沙和馬莉婭，我愛你們，我對你們的愛超出了你們的想象。你們已贏得了新的寵物狗，它將和我們一起前往新的白宮。,Sasha and Malia! I love you both more than you can imagine. And you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House.
347823,cmn,盡管她沒能和我們在一起，但我知道，我的祖母和養大我的家人在看著我，我今晚很想念他們，我知道我欠他們的東西是無法計量的。我的妹妹馬婭、我的姐姐奧瑪，我其他的兄弟和姐妹，非常感謝你們對我的支持，我感謝他們。我的妹妹馬婭、我的姐姐奧瑪，我其他的兄弟和姐妹，非常感謝你們對我的支持，我感謝他們。,"And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight. I know that my debt to them is beyond measure. To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters, thank you so much for all the support that you've given me. I'm grateful to them."
347824,cmn,我的競選經理大衛-普勞夫，這位競選活動的無名英雄，他進行了最好的政治競選活動，我認為這是美國歷史上最棒的。,"To my campaign manager, David Plouffe! The unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best, the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America."
347825,cmn,我的首席策略師大衛-艾克斯羅德，他一直是追隨我的夥伴。你們組建了政治史上最好的競選團隊，是你們成就了今天，我永遠感謝你們為此所作出的犧牲。,"To my chief strategist, David Axelrod, who's been a partner with me every step of the way. To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics! You made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done."
347827,cmn,但最重要的是，我永遠不會忘記這場勝利真正屬於誰，它屬於你們，它屬於你們。,"But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you."
347829,cmn,我從來不是最有可能獲得這一職務的候選人。我們剛開始並沒有太多資金，也沒有得到許多人的支持。我們的競選活動並非始自華盛頓的大廳裏，而是始於得梅因、康科德、查爾斯頓這些地方的普通民眾家中。那些辛勤工作的人們從自己微薄的儲蓄中捐出5美元、10美元、20美元。,"I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines, and the living rooms of Concord, and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause."
347831,cmn,競選活動因為年輕人的支持而越來越有聲勢，他們拒絕了他們那一代對政治不感興趣的神話，他們離開家，從事那些薪水少而且辛苦的工作。,"It drew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep."
347834,cmn,競選活動的聲勢也來自那些已不再年輕的人們，他們冒著嚴寒酷暑，敲開陌生人的家門進行競選宣傳；競選聲勢也源自數百萬的美國民眾，他們充當誌願者和組織者，他們證明了在兩百多年以後，民有、民治、民享的政府並未從地球上消失。這是你們的勝利。,"It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth."
347836,cmn,這是你們的勝利。,This is your victory.
347838,cmn,我知道你們的所做的一切並不只是為了贏得選舉，我也知道你們做這一切並不是為了我。你們這樣做是因為你們明白前面的任務有多麼艱巨。即便我們今晚歡呼慶祝，我們也知道明天將面臨我們一生之中最艱難的挑戰——兩場戰爭、一個面臨危險的星球，一個世紀以來最嚴重的金融危機。,"And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century."
347840,cmn,就在我們今晚站在這裏的時刻，我們知道勇敢的美國士兵在伊拉克的沙漠裏和阿富汗的群山中醒來，他們冒著生命危險來保護著我們的生命。,"Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, to risk their lives for us."
347842,cmn,仍有在孩子熟睡後仍難以入眠的父母，他們擔心如何償還按揭月供、付醫藥費或是存夠錢讓孩子上大學。,"There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for their child's college education."
347844,cmn,我們需要開發新的能源、創造新的工作崗位，我們需要修建新學校，應對眾多威脅、修復與許多國家的盟友關系。,"There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair."
347846,cmn,前方的道路將很漫長，我們攀登的腳步會很艱辛。我們可能無法在一年甚至一個任期內實現這些目標，但我從未像今晚這樣滿懷希望，我們將實現我們的目標。,"The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we WILL get there."
347848,cmn,我向你們承諾——我們作為一個整體將會達成目標。,"I promise you, we as a people will get there."
347850,cmn,但我將總是會向你們坦陳我們所面臨的挑戰。我會聽取你們的意見，尤其是存在不同意見的時候。最重要的是，我會請求你們參與重建這個國家，以美國221年來從未改變的唯一方式-一磚一瓦、同心協力。,"But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years; block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand."
347852,cmn,我們會遭遇挫折和不成功的起步。我作為總統所做的每項決定或政策，會有許多人持有異議，我們也知道，政府不能解決所有問題。,There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem.
347854,cmn,21個月前在寒冬所開始的一切不應當在今天這個秋夜結束。今天的選舉勝利並不是我們所尋求的改變--這只是我們進行改變的機會。如果我們仍然按照過去的方式行事，我們所尋求的改變將不會發生。沒有你們，沒有服務和犧牲的新精神，就不可能發生改變。因此，讓我們發揚新的愛國和負責精神，所有的人都下定決心參與其中，更加努力地工作，不僅是為自己而是為彼此。,"What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other."
347857,cmn,讓我們記住這一點，如果說這場金融危機教會了我們什麼東西的話，那就是我們不可能在金融以外的領域處於困境的同時擁有繁榮興旺的華爾街。,"Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers."
347859,cmn,在這個國家，我們患難與共。讓我們抵制重走老路的誘惑，避免重新回到令美國政治長期深受毒害的黨派紛爭、小題大作、不成熟的表現。,"In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long."
347861,cmn,讓我們記住，是伊利諾伊州的一名男子首次將共和黨的旗幟扛到了白宮。共和黨是建立在自立、個人自由以及國家團結的價值觀之上的。這也是我們所有人共同的價值觀。雖然民主黨今天晚上贏得了巨大的勝利，但我們是以謙卑的態度和彌合阻礙我們進步的分歧的決心贏得這場勝利的,"Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress."
347863,cmn,林肯在向遠比我們眼下分歧更大的國家發表講話時說，我們不是敵人，而是朋友……雖然激情可能會褪去，但這不會割斷我們感情上的聯系。,"As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection."
347865,cmn,對於那些現在沒有投票給我的美國人，我想說，我可能沒有贏得你們的選票，但是我聽到了你們的聲音，我需要你們的幫助，而且我也將是你們的總統,"And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too."
347867,cmn,對於那些徹夜關註美國大選的海外人士，從國會到皇宮，以及在被遺忘的角落裏擠在收音機旁的人們，我們的經歷雖然各有不同，但是我們的命運是一樣的，新的美國領導層已產生了。,"And all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand."
347869,cmn,那些想要顛覆這個世界的人們，我們將擊敗你們。,To those who would tear the world down: we will defeat you.
347871,cmn,那些追求和平和安全的人們，我們支持你們。那些所有懷疑美國的燈塔能否能像以前一樣明亮的人們，今天晚上我們再次證明，我們國家真正的力量並非來自我們武器的威力或財富的規模，而是來自我們理想的持久力量：民主、 自由、機會、不屈服的希望。,"To those who seek peace and security. We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright, tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope."
347873,cmn,這才是美國真正的精華——美國能夠改變。我們的聯邦會日漸完美。我們現在已取得的成就為我們將來能夠取得和必須取得的成就增添了希望。,That's the true genius of America; that America can change. Our Union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
347875,cmn,這次大選創造了多項第一，也誕生了很多將世代流傳的故事。但是今天晚上令我難忘的卻是在亞特蘭大投票的一名婦女：安-尼克松-庫波爾。她和其他數百萬排隊等待投票的選民沒有什麼差別，除了一點：她已是106歲的高齡。,"This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election, except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old."
347877,cmn,她出生的那個時代奴隸制度剛剛結束；那時路上沒有汽車，天上也沒有飛機。當時像她這樣的人由於兩個原因不能投票，首先她是女性，其次她是黑人。,"She was born just a generation past slavery. A time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky, when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman, and because of the color of her skin."
347879,cmn,今天晚上，我想到了她在美國過去一百年間所經歷的種種：心痛和希望；鬥爭和進步；在那裏時代，我們被告知我們辦不到，一些人繼續堅信著美國的信念——是的，我們能做到。,"And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America. The heartache and the hope, the struggle and the progress. The times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes, we can."
347881,cmn,婦女當時沒有投票權，她們的希望被挫敗，但是安-尼克松-庫波爾活著看到婦女們站了起來，看到她們站出來發表自己的見解，看到她們參加大選投票。是的，我們能做到。,"At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes, we can."
347883,cmn,當30年代的沙塵暴和大蕭條使人們感到絕望時，她看到一個國家用新政、新的就業機會以及對新目標的共同追求戰勝恐慌。是的，我們能做到。,"When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes, we can."
347885,cmn,當炸彈襲擊了我們的港口、暴政威脅到全世界，她見證了一代美國人的偉大崛起，見證了一個民主國家獲得拯救。是的，我們能做到。,"When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness, and a democracy was saved. Yes, we can."
347887,cmn,她看到蒙哥馬利通了公共汽車、伯明翰接上了水管、塞爾馬建了橋，一位來自亞特蘭大的傳教士告訴人們：“我們將克服阻力。”是的，我們能做到。,"She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that ""We Shall Overcome."" Yes, we can."
347889,cmn,人類登上月球、柏林墻倒下，世界被我們的科學和想像被連接在一起。,A man touched down on the moon. A wall came down in Berlin. A world was connected by our own science and imagination.
347891,cmn,今年，在這場選舉中，她用手指觸摸屏幕投下自己的選票，因為在美國生活了106年之後，經歷了最好的時光和最黑暗的時刻之後，她知道美國如何能夠發生變革。,"And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote; because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change."
347895,cmn,美國，我們已經走過了一條漫漫長路。我們已經歷了很多。但是我們仍有很多事情要做。因此今夜，請讓我們自問--如果我們的孩子能夠活到下個世紀；如果我的女兒有幸活得和安一樣長，她們將會看到怎樣的改變？我們將會取得什麼樣的進步。,"America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves, if our children should live to see the next century, if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?"
347896,cmn,是的，我們能做到,"Yes, we can."
347898,cmn,現在是我們回答這個問題的機會。這是我們的時刻這是我們的時代--讓我們的人民重新就業，為我們的後代敞開機會之門，恢復繁榮，推進和平，重新確立“美國夢”，再次證明這樣一個基本的真理：我們是一家人；只要一息尚存，我們就有希望；當我們遇到嘲諷和懷疑，當有人說我們辦不到的時候，我們要以這個永恒的信條來回應他們。是的，我們能做到,"This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes,"

888414,cmn,對我而言，這兩個國家的文化沒有什麼根本的區別。,"To me, there aren't any fundamental differences between the cultures of these two countries."
888416,cmn,因為我們都是人類，所以我的觀點是每個國家的文化其實百分之九十一樣。,"We're all human beings, so in my opinion each country's culture is 90% the same."
888418,cmn,雖然人們喜歡集中於不同的方面，但是我認為大部分的差不多。,"Although people like to focus on the differences, I think that on the whole it's the same."
888420,cmn,回答這個問題時，有的人可能提出“中國人很好客而英國人比較矜持的”這樣的例子。,"When answering this question, some people might put forward this kind of example: ""Chinese people are very hospitable, whilst English people are more reserved."""
888422,cmn,這個看法可能是正確的。,Maybe this opinion is correct.

888428,cmn,好像所有的人喜歡大方地歡迎客人來他們家。,It seems that everyone likes to be generous in welcoming guests to their home.
888432,cmn,如果這兩個文化有真實的不同，我認為最大的準是在關於外國人學習自己的母語的意見。,"If there are genuine differences between these two cultures, I think that the largest are certainly in what you think about foreigners studying your native language."
888437,cmn,我覺得英國人可能比別的國家習慣跟語言學習者說話。,I think that English people might be more used to language learners than people in other countries.
888441,cmn,這是因為英語是全球性的語言。,This is due to English being a world language.
888443,cmn,世界上學習英語的人很多，所以英國人習慣學習者的不標準的口音、語法錯誤等等。,"There are many people in the world studying English, so English people are used to learners' non-standard accents, their grammatical errors and so on."
888449,cmn,結果是英國人平時沒問題聽得懂外國人說的話。,The result is that English people usually have no problem understanding what foreigners say.
888457,cmn,當然，對這個情況的另一個解釋是中文比英文難學。,"Of course, another explanation of this situation is that Chinese is harder to learn than English."
888461,cmn,而且，我還是認為這準不是個巨大的文化區別。,"Furthermore, I still don't think this a huge cultural difference."
