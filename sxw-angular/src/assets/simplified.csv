347801,cmn,如果外头还有人怀疑，美国是否真的是任何事都可能发生的地方，怀疑我们开国先贤的梦想今天是否依然存在，怀疑我们民主的力量；今夜，就是你们要的答桉。,"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer."
347803,cmn,这是个用这个国家前所未见的，环绕学校、教堂的无数人龙，所说出的答桉。这些人苦等三、四个小时投票，许多人还是生平头一次，因为他们相信，这次一定要不一样，他们的声音就是明证。,"It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches, in numbers this nation has never seen. By people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference."
347807,cmn,你来上海多少时间了？,For how long are you in Shanghai?
347811,cmn,这是个由不分老少、贫富、民主党、共和党；黑人、白人、拉丁裔、亚裔、美洲原住民；同性恋、异性恋人；肢障与四体健全者，大家共同诉说的答桉。美国民众向全世界发出讯息，我们绝非一盘散沙，也不是由红州、蓝州拼凑而成的集合体。,"It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and always will be, the United States of America."
347814,cmn,看，这是我的名片。,"Look, this is my business card."
347816,cmn,就是这个答桉，让那些长久以来被灌输要嘲讽、害怕和怀疑自身能力的人们 把他们的手放在历史的弧线上，将它弯向一个更美好的一天的希望。,"It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long, by so many, to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve, to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day."
347817,cmn,已经过去了很长时间，但是今晚，由于我们今天在这场选举所采取的行动，在这个决定性的时候，变革来到了美国。,"It's been a long time coming; but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America."
347818,cmn,今晚稍早，我接到马侃参议员打来，态度非常恳切的电话。马侃参议员已打完一场漫长艰苦的选战。他为这个他所热爱的国家所打的仗更久，更艰苦。他为美国的奉献牺牲，是我们多数同胞难以想像的。因为有他这位勇敢无私的领袖的奉献，我们才能过比较好的日子。,"A little bit earlier this evening, I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Senator McCain. Senator McCain fought long and hard in this campaign. And he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader."
347819,cmn,我向他道贺；也向裴林州长道贺，为他们所成就的一切。我迫不及待想和他们携手合作，在未来数月更新这个国家的许诺。,"I congratulate him, I congratulate Governor Palin for all that they've achieved. And I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead."
347820,cmn,我要感谢我的选举搭档，这位先生全心全意竞选，为与他在史克兰顿街头一起长大的男男女女代言。在前往德拉瓦州的路上，和我一起以火车为家，他就是副总统当选人，拜登先生。,"I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart, and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton, and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the vice president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden."
347821,cmn,如果没有我过去16年最好的朋友、我们家庭的中坚、我生命中的挚爱，我今天晚上不可能站在这里，美国下一位第一夫人米歇尔-奥巴马。,"And I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next first lady, Michelle Obama."
347822,cmn,萨沙和马莉娅，我爱你们，我对你们的爱超出了你们的想象。你们已赢得了新的宠物狗，它将和我们一起前往新的白宫。,Sasha and Malia! I love you both more than you can imagine. And you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House.
347823,cmn,尽管她没能和我们在一起，但我知道，我的祖母和养大我的家人在看着我，我今晚很想念他们，我知道我欠他们的东西是无法计量的。我的妹妹马娅、我的姐姐奥玛，我其他的兄弟和姐妹，非常感谢你们对我的支持，我感谢他们。我的妹妹马娅、我的姐姐奥玛，我其他的兄弟和姐妹，非常感谢你们对我的支持，我感谢他们。,"And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight. I know that my debt to them is beyond measure. To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters, thank you so much for all the support that you've given me. I'm grateful to them."
347824,cmn,我的竞选经理大卫-普劳夫，这位竞选活动的无名英雄，他进行了最好的政治竞选活动，我认为这是美国历史上最棒的。,"To my campaign manager, David Plouffe! The unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best, the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America."
347825,cmn,我的首席策略师大卫-艾克斯罗德，他一直是追随我的伙伴。你们组建了政治史上最好的竞选团队，是你们成就了今天，我永远感谢你们为此所作出的牺牲。,"To my chief strategist, David Axelrod, who's been a partner with me every step of the way. To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics! You made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done."
347827,cmn,但最重要的是，我永远不会忘记这场胜利真正属于谁，它属于你们，它属于你们。,"But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you."
347829,cmn,我从来不是最有可能获得这一职务的候选人。我们刚开始并没有太多资金，也没有得到许多人的支持。我们的竞选活动并非始自华盛顿的大厅里，而是始于得梅因、康科德、查尔斯顿这些地方的普通民众家中。那些辛勤工作的人们从自己微薄的储蓄中捐出5美元、10美元、20美元。,"I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines, and the living rooms of Concord, and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause."
347831,cmn,竞选活动因为年轻人的支持而越来越有声势，他们拒绝了他们那一代对政治不感兴趣的神话，他们离开家，从事那些薪水少而且辛苦的工作。,"It drew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep."
347834,cmn,竞选活动的声势也来自那些已不再年轻的人们，他们冒着严寒酷暑，敲开陌生人的家门进行竞选宣传；竞选声势也源自数百万的美国民众，他们充当志愿者和组织者，他们证明了在两百多年以后，民有、民治、民享的政府并未从地球上消失。这是你们的胜利。,"It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth."
347836,cmn,这是你们的胜利。,This is your victory.
347838,cmn,我知道你们的所做的一切并不只是为了赢得选举，我也知道你们做这一切并不是为了我。你们这样做是因为你们明白前面的任务有多么艰巨。即便我们今晚欢呼庆祝，我们也知道明天将面临我们一生之中最艰难的挑战——两场战争、一个面临危险的星球，一个世纪以来最严重的金融危机。,"And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century."
347840,cmn,就在我们今晚站在这里的时刻，我们知道勇敢的美国士兵在伊拉克的沙漠里和阿富汗的群山中醒来，他们冒着生命危险来保护着我们的生命。,"Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, to risk their lives for us."
347842,cmn,仍有在孩子熟睡后仍难以入眠的父母，他们担心如何偿还按揭月供、付医药费或是存够钱让孩子上大学。,"There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for their child's college education."
347844,cmn,我们需要开发新的能源、创造新的工作岗位，我们需要修建新学校，应对众多威胁、修复与许多国家的盟友关系。,"There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair."
347846,cmn,前方的道路将很漫长，我们攀登的脚步会很艰辛。我们可能无法在一年甚至一个任期内实现这些目标，但我从未像今晚这样满怀希望，我们将实现我们的目标。,"The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we WILL get there."
347848,cmn,我向你们承诺——我们作为一个整体将会达成目标。,"I promise you, we as a people will get there."
347850,cmn,但我将总是会向你们坦陈我们所面临的挑战。我会听取你们的意见，尤其是存在不同意见的时候。最重要的是，我会请求你们参与重建这个国家，以美国221年来从未改变的唯一方式-一砖一瓦、同心协力。,"But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years; block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand."
347852,cmn,我们会遭遇挫折和不成功的起步。我作为总统所做的每项决定或政策，会有许多人持有异议，我们也知道，政府不能解决所有问题。,There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem.
347854,cmn,21个月前在寒冬所开始的一切不应当在今天这个秋夜结束。今天的选举胜利并不是我们所寻求的改变--这只是我们进行改变的机会。如果我们仍然按照过去的方式行事，我们所寻求的改变将不会发生。没有你们，没有服务和牺牲的新精神，就不可能发生改变。因此，让我们发扬新的爱国和负责精神，所有的人都下定决心参与其中，更加努力地工作，不仅是为自己而是为彼此。,"What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other."
347857,cmn,让我们记住这一点，如果说这场金融危机教会了我们什么东西的话，那就是我们不可能在金融以外的领域处于困境的同时拥有繁荣兴旺的华尔街。,"Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers."
347859,cmn,在这个国家，我们患难与共。让我们抵制重走老路的诱惑，避免重新回到令美国政治长期深受毒害的党派纷争、小题大作、不成熟的表现。,"In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long."
347861,cmn,让我们记住，是伊利诺伊州的一名男子首次将共和党的旗帜扛到了白宫。共和党是建立在自立、个人自由以及国家团结的价值观之上的。这也是我们所有人共同的价值观。虽然民主党今天晚上赢得了巨大的胜利，但我们是以谦卑的态度和弥合阻碍我们进步的分歧的决心赢得这场胜利的,"Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress."
347863,cmn,林肯在向远比我们眼下分歧更大的国家发表讲话时说，我们不是敌人，而是朋友……虽然激情可能会褪去，但这不会割断我们感情上的联系。,"As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection."
347865,cmn,对于那些现在没有投票给我的美国人，我想说，我可能没有赢得你们的选票，但是我听到了你们的声音，我需要你们的帮助，而且我也将是你们的总统,"And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too."
347867,cmn,对于那些彻夜关注美国大选的海外人士，从国会到皇宫，以及在被遗忘的角落里挤在收音机旁的人们，我们的经历虽然各有不同，但是我们的命运是一样的，新的美国领导层已产生了。,"And all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand."
347869,cmn,那些想要颠覆这个世界的人们，我们将击败你们。,To those who would tear the world down: we will defeat you.
347871,cmn,那些追求和平和安全的人们，我们支持你们。那些所有怀疑美国的灯塔能否能像以前一样明亮的人们，今天晚上我们再次证明，我们国家真正的力量并非来自我们武器的威力或财富的规模，而是来自我们理想的持久力量：民主、 自由、机会、不屈服的希望。,"To those who seek peace and security. We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright, tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope."
347873,cmn,这才是美国真正的精华——美国能够改变。我们的联邦会日渐完美。我们现在已取得的成就为我们将来能够取得和必须取得的成就增添了希望。,That's the true genius of America; that America can change. Our Union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
347875,cmn,这次大选创造了多项第一，也诞生了很多将世代流传的故事。但是今天晚上令我难忘的却是在亚特兰大投票的一名妇女：安-尼克松-库波尔。她和其他数百万排队等待投票的选民没有什么差别，除了一点：她已是106岁的高龄。,"This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election, except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old."
347877,cmn,她出生的那个时代奴隶制度刚刚结束；那时路上没有汽车，天上也没有飞机。当时像她这样的人由于两个原因不能投票，首先她是女性，其次她是黑人。,"She was born just a generation past slavery. A time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky, when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman, and because of the color of her skin."
347879,cmn,今天晚上，我想到了她在美国过去一百年间所经历的种种：心痛和希望；斗争和进步；在那里时代，我们被告知我们办不到，一些人继续坚信着美国的信念——是的，我们能做到。,"And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America. The heartache and the hope, the struggle and the progress. The times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes, we can."
347881,cmn,妇女当时没有投票权，她们的希望被挫败，但是安-尼克松-库波尔活着看到妇女们站了起来，看到她们站出来发表自己的见解，看到她们参加大选投票。是的，我们能做到。,"At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes, we can."
347883,cmn,当30年代的沙尘暴和大萧条使人们感到绝望时，她看到一个国家用新政、新的就业机会以及对新目标的共同追求战胜恐慌。是的，我们能做到。,"When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes, we can."
347885,cmn,当炸弹袭击了我们的港口、暴政威胁到全世界，她见证了一代美国人的伟大崛起，见证了一个民主国家获得拯救。是的，我们能做到。,"When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness, and a democracy was saved. Yes, we can."
347887,cmn,她看到蒙哥马利通了公共汽车、伯明翰接上了水管、塞尔马建了桥，一位来自亚特兰大的传教士告诉人们：“我们将克服阻力。”是的，我们能做到。,"She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that ""We Shall Overcome."" Yes, we can."
347889,cmn,人类登上月球、柏林墙倒下，世界被我们的科学和想像被连接在一起。,A man touched down on the moon. A wall came down in Berlin. A world was connected by our own science and imagination.
347891,cmn,今年，在这场选举中，她用手指触摸屏幕投下自己的选票，因为在美国生活了106年之后，经历了最好的时光和最黑暗的时刻之后，她知道美国如何能够发生变革。,"And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote; because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change."
347895,cmn,美国，我们已经走过了一条漫漫长路。我们已经历了很多。但是我们仍有很多事情要做。因此今夜，请让我们自问--如果我们的孩子能够活到下个世纪；如果我的女儿有幸活得和安一样长，她们将会看到怎样的改变？我们将会取得什么样的进步。,"America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves, if our children should live to see the next century, if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?"
347896,cmn,是的，我们能做到,"Yes, we can."
347898,cmn,现在是我们回答这个问题的机会。这是我们的时刻这是我们的时代--让我们的人民重新就业，为我们的后代敞开机会之门，恢复繁荣，推进和平，重新确立“美国梦”，再次证明这样一个基本的真理：我们是一家人；只要一息尚存，我们就有希望；当我们遇到嘲讽和怀疑，当有人说我们办不到的时候，我们要以这个永恒的信条来回应他们。是的，我们能做到,"This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes,"

888416,cmn,因为我们都是人类，所以我的观点是每个国家的文化其实百分之九十一样。,"We're all human beings, so in my opinion each country's culture is 90% the same."
888418,cmn,虽然人们喜欢集中于不同的方面，但是我认为大部分的差不多。,"Although people like to focus on the differences, I think that on the whole it's the same."
888420,cmn,回答这个问题时，有的人可能提出“中国人很好客而英国人比较矜持的”这样的例子。,"When answering this question, some people might put forward this kind of example: ""Chinese people are very hospitable, whilst English people are more reserved."""
888422,cmn,这个看法可能是正确的。,Maybe this opinion is correct.
888424,cmn,不过，我从来没有在一个小气的英国家庭做过客。,"However, I've never been a guest in an English household that wasn't generous."
888428,cmn,好像所有的人喜欢大方地欢迎客人来他们家。,It seems that everyone likes to be generous in welcoming guests to their home.
888432,cmn,如果这两个文化有真实的不同，我认为最大的准是在关于外国人学习自己的母语的意见。,"If there are genuine differences between these two cultures, I think that the largest are certainly in what you think about foreigners studying your native language."
888437,cmn,我觉得英国人可能比别的国家习惯跟语言学习者说话。,I think that English people might be more used to language learners than people in other countries.
888441,cmn,这是因为英语是全球性的语言。,This is due to English being a world language.
888443,cmn,世界上学习英语的人很多，所以英国人习惯学习者的不标准的口音、语法错误等等。,"There are many people in the world studying English, so English people are used to learners' non-standard accents, their grammatical errors and so on."
888449,cmn,结果是英国人平时没问题听得懂外国人说的话。,The result is that English people usually have no problem understanding what foreigners say.
888457,cmn,当然，对这个情况的另一个解释是中文比英文难学。,"Of course, another explanation of this situation is that Chinese is harder to learn than English."
888461,cmn,而且，我还是认为这准不是个巨大的文化区别。,"Furthermore, I still don't think this a huge cultural difference."
